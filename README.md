# Census-API-Downloader
This personal project is one I started to solidify my understanding of front-end development. The website provides a very simple, light-weight interface integrated with the Census Bureau API to visualize and download demographic data. 

I prepared this because I believe that the Census Bureau site is not easy to navigate to when you just want to quickly visualize data.
